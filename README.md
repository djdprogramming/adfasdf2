# David's Personal Roadmap to Learning Data Science
#### Based on the article [Learn Data Science for free in 2021](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/01/learn-data-science-free-2021.html) from KDnuggets. Some additions have been made.
###### I'm new to data science and programming. Some areas of study in this roadmap may be researched to a point of redundancy while materials for other topics could be seriously lacking. As I progress through this learning path, I'll be able to gauge which areas need more (or less) focus and will add and remove resources as needed.

## Schoolwork
